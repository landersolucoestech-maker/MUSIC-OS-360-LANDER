# Documentation lives at the repository root `docs/`, not here

This directory exists so the path `.claude/docs/` resolves to something real rather than a
404/missing-directory surprise, but it deliberately does **not** duplicate content — one concept,
one location, per `.claude/rules/naming-canonical.md`'s "one data field, one source of truth"
principle applied to documentation itself.

The pack's actual documentation — architecture, operations, the naming-normalization doc trio, and
the full mission specification — lives at the repository root: `../../docs/` relative to this file
(i.e. `docs/` at the repo root, alongside `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`).

If a future need genuinely requires pack-internal documentation that shouldn't live at the product
root (rare — most projects want one `docs/` location), add it here explicitly and update this file
to explain why it's split, rather than letting content silently drift into two places.
