# SECRET-01 regression test — proves gitleaks actually scans docs/**/*.md.
#
# Creates a throwaway Markdown file under docs/ containing a synthetic secret
# that matches gitleaks' default AWS Access Key ID rule (never a real key),
# runs `gitleaks detect` against the working tree, and asserts it is caught.
# Removes the file afterwards regardless of outcome.
#
# Requires the `gitleaks` CLI in PATH (installed by security.yml's secret-scan
# job before calling this script; NOT installed by this script itself).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test-gitleaks-docs-coverage.sh

# NOT AWS's canonical "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" placeholder: gitleaks' own default
# ruleset carries a built-in rule-level allowlist regex `.+EXAMPLE$` that
# exempts exactly that value, regardless of .gitleaks.toml.
#
# Also NOT an arbitrary AKIA+16-alphanumeric string: gitleaks v8.30.1
# tightened the aws-access-token regex from [A-Z0-9]{16} to [A-Z2-7]{16}
# (real AWS access key IDs are Base32-encoded — digits 0/1/8/9 never appear).
# `:latest` in security.yml's Docker-based regression step floats to
# whatever version is newest (confirmed v8.30.1 at the time of writing, vs.
# v8.24.3 pinned by gitleaks-action@v2 earlier in the same job — a real,
# pre-existing version drift between the two gitleaks invocations), so this
# value uses ONLY [A-Z2-7] in its 16-char suffix to match both versions'
# regex. Shannon entropy ~4.0 (above the rule's threshold of 3 — computed
# and verified against the real image before use). Hand-typed for this test
# only: never a real or provisioned credential, never reused elsewhere.
