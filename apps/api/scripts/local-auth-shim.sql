-- Real Supabase projects grant SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on every

-- default (RLS policies alone don't grant access — Postgres still requires
-- the base table privilege). This project's migrations never issue that
-- grant themselves because they assume that platform baseline exists
-- already.
--
-- This used to be replicated via `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`, but that rule
-- is just another default-privileges entry — indistinguishable from any
-- other migration's own `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES ... REVOKE` (e.g.
-- HardenRbacAclDefaults20260613000017, which intentionally revokes the
-- default-privileges rule for musicos360/musicos_migrator as part of
-- least-privilege hardening for RBAC tables). Once that revoke runs, every
-- table created afterwards — including the 2026-07-19 "canonical form
-- order" rebuilds (artists, works, phonograms, clients, contracts,
-- employees, ...), which DROP+CREATE the table and only explicitly
-- re-grant musicos_migrator — silently loses the emulated platform grant
-- locally. Real Supabase never has this problem: its auto-grant is an
-- internal platform mechanism, not a `pg_default_acl` entry a project's own
-- migrations can revoke. An event trigger reproduces that independence:
-- it fires on every CREATE TABLE regardless of what any migration did to
-- default privileges, so a later explicit REVOKE (e.g. this project's own
-- RLS-hardening migrations) still wins, exactly like on real Supabase.
